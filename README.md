# cgmsim-runner-ui

This cross-platform application (built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)) allows you to use the public [cgmsim-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lsandini/cgmsim-lib) library in a local environment. The same library is used by the cloud-based [CGMSIM v.3](https://cgmsim.com) Type I diabetes simulator.

You will need to deploy an instance of [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/) in order to visualize the CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) data graphically.

## Description

The library of functions [cgmsim-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lsandini/cgmsim-lib) performs computations for a defined virtual subject with Type I Diabetes. While initially designed for a cloud-based use, we designed a runner application with a user interface for local use. 

You will have to define physically your subject (Age, Gender, Height, Weight), and their physiological properties (Insulin Sensitivity Factor, Carbs-to-Insulin Ratio, etc). With all settings defined, the runner will start computing new CGM values every 5 minutes, displaying them in the main window, and uploading them to your Nightscout instance.

All treatment events (meals, insulin doses) must be declared in Nightscout's Careportal, as described in the [CGMSIM v.3 documentation](https://cgmsim.com/support/nightscout/meals.html).
